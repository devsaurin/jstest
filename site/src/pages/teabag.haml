  h2. Running tests with Teaspoon

  If you've gone through the "Getting started":/intro.html tutorial, this
  article will show you how to run your tests using
  "Teaspoon":https://github.com/modeset/teaspoon.

  Teaspoon is a JavaScript test running for Rails. @jstest@ has a "reporter
  plugin":/reporters.html that will autodetect if you're using Teaspoon and wire
  everything up for you. To get started, add @teaspoon@ to your @Gemfile@:

  <pre># Gemfile

  gem 'teaspoon'</pre>

  Then run the following commands to install Teaspoon in your app:

  <pre class="cmd">$ bundle update teaspoon
  $ rails generate teaspoon:install</pre>

  Let's copy the example files from "Getting started":/intro.html into this
  project.

  <pre class="cmd">cp build/jstest.js          teaspoon_demo/vendor/assets/javascripts/jstest.js
  cp example/lib/set.js       teaspoon_demo/app/assets/javascripts/set.js
  cp example/spec/set_spec.js teaspoon_demo/spec/javascripts/set_spec.js</pre>

  To load @jstest.js@ and @set.js@ into the test page, add this to
  @spec/javascripts/spec_helper.js@:

  <pre>// spec/javascripts/spec_helper.js

  //= require jstest
  //= require set</pre>

  Then boot your Rails app and open @http://localhost:3000/teaspoon@. You should
  see this page:

  Clicking the link to @set_spec.js@ should run that test and show you the
  results.
